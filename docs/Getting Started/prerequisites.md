# Prerequisites

**Reflectis Creator Kit** is a library of interactive prefabs and individual scripts that define various behaviors and interactions within Reflectis environments.

Additionally, several drag-and-drop prefabs are present in the scene and ready for use:

- Big screen
- Whiteboard Surface
- Teleport
- Scene Changer
- Private Voice Area
- User List
- User List Panel
- Tutorial Panel
- Visual Scripting

However, before using them, it's necessary to **set up the project, set up the scene,** and **install and set up the addressable system** to receive the Creator Kit and all its functionalities.

Remember that the platform allows for the creation of **VR and WebGL** experiences, enabling both systems to coexist.

_Enjoy envisioning new possible worlds and interactions for the different player bases at your disposal!_

### What you need

1. The first thing you need is to have **Unity** installed. You need version **2022.3.1** to be able to test in your sandbox space. 

	If you don't have the **Unity Hub** installed yet, you need to install it first (download [here](https://unity.com/download)). 
Once you have Unity Hub, you can install **Unity 2022.3.1**:
	- Go to [this page](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) (tab "**Unity 2022.X**")
	- Click the "**Unity Hub**" button next to 2022.3.1

2. Then **Git** must be installed on your computer, otherwise the **package manager of Unity** won't be able to read the packages from the correct Github's repositories		. 
Go to https://git-scm.com/ and download the latest release for the correct platform.
:::danger[Warning]
Git must be downloaded while Unity and Unity Hub are **closed** or the Unity system won't read the new installed application.
