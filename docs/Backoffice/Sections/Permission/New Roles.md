This will open up a new window with three sections.

- The first section manages the name and the color of the Role itself. It is possible to set a role as “Visible” so other people can see it under the nametag in the application. 
- In the second section it's possible to associate the Role to specific users, or remove them.
- The third section it’s where the permits and powers are associated with that tag.

*The number of permissions and capabilities that can be associated with roles significantly exceeds the options available for tags. Tags primarily serve as organizational structures for users, while roles are instrumental in defining social distinctions within the application.*_
