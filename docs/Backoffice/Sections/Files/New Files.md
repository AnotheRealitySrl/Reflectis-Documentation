## Choose a folder
Choose the folder into which the asset will be deposited from the existing list of folders.

## Upload an Asset File
Choose the desired asset file for upload. Currently, supported file formats for upload include:
- Images: .jpg and .png
- Videos: .mp4
- 3D Models: .GLB
- Documents: PDF

## Choose a thumbnail 
While not obligatory, selecting a thumbnail is highly recommended to facilitate faster asset identification. In this section, users have the option to upload an image to serve as the thumbnail for the file. If the file itself is already an image, the same image will be automatically used as the thumbnail. The option to toggle thumbnail upload is available for cases where a thumbnail is not necessary or desired.
