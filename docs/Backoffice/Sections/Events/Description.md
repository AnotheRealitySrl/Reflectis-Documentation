Events serve as the primary focal point within the application. An event is a distinctive 3D environment featuring specific interactions and mechanics, accessible to users for a designated time period through the application.

Events already started and in progress cannot be edited or deleted. Drafts already started cannot be published.
The options displayed for events in the event page can vary depending on how the events were initially configured.
