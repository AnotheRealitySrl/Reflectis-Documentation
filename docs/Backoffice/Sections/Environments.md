The 'Environments' section comprises all supplementary 3D environments accessible within the application. Each environment can possess unique visual designs and interactions customized to meet user preferences and the specific needs of the application.

Any new environment introduced in this section becomes accessible for use when creating a new event. As a result, it is made available within the application, ensuring its availability going forward.

# New Environment

Creating a new environment requires the utilization of the SDK creation kit provided alongside the application. For detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and using the SDK, please refer to the [Reflectis Creator Kit](http://localhost:3000/docs/CK/intro).
