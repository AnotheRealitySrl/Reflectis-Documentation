# Introduction

The Back Office is a platform that enables specific users to oversee and control the resources and activities in which other users will participate.
Typically, the individuals with access to this platform hold managerial positions or have ownership rights over the application.

Access to the site is restricted to the use of an official Animator's or Owner's account for logging in. Registration for the site is to be overseen internally by the highest authority. Within the Back Office site, authorized users will discover various sections dedicated to the management of distinct aspects of the application.

New users are initially assigned the USER role, which comes with basic permissions and serves as the standard role for newly registered users. The ADMIN role is typically granted to the owner, enabling them with permissions to oversee all aspects of the back office.
