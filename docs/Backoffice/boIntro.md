# Introduction

The **backoffice** is a platform that enables specific users to oversee and control the resources and activities in which other users will participate.
Typically, the individuals with access to this platform hold **managerial positions** or have **ownership rights** over the application.

Registration for the site is to be overseen internally by the highest authority. Within the **backoffice site**, authorized users will discover various sections dedicated to the management of distinct aspects of the application, based on one's role.

Currently, the roles present in Reflectis are:
- **User**: new users are initially assigned this role, which comes with basic permissions
- **Manager**: this role is chosen by the platform owner and is used to give permissions to manage certain features of the platform
- **Admin**: this role is typically granted to the owner, enabling them with permissions to oversee all aspects of the backoffice.

The sections of which the backoffice is composed are:
- [**World**](World): general section where to control access to the platform
- [**Categories**](Categories): section where to create labels to assign to events
- [**Events**](Events/Description): section to create and manage public or private events on the platform
