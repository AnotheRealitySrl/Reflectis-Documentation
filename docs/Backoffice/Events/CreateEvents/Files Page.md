From this page, users have the ability to designate which files **will be accessible** to participants upon entering a specific event.

By clicking the button located on the left side of the file's name, the file **can be shared** with the event.

Users also have the option to **search for** files based on folders or by specifying the type of asset contained within the file. 

All assets listed here have been previously uploaded in the [**Files**](Files) section of the backoffice and can also be managed from that section.
