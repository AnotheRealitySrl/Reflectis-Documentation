On this page, users have the option to determine the event's accessibility, classifying it as either **public** or **private**. Public events can be further categorized as either **limited to 30 users** or open to an **unlimited number** of participants.
Users can configure a Public Event as a "**Static Event**". Each environment can have only one Static Event. Environments that have a static event can be associated to the **Scene changer** component in the lobby. Scene changers are teleports that transport the player to specific environments and can be placed and modified through the SDK creator kit. 

Conversely, **private events** offer the choice of being concealed from all users except guests or visible to all users but restricted to guests. Moreover, from this page, users can retrieve the **shareable link** to the event.

Once the selection process has been completed, users are required to click the "**Next**" button located at the bottom right corner of the page. Alternatively, they have the option to use the "**Back**" button to return to the previous page and make modifications to other information.
