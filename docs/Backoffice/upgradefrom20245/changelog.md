# Changelog

The upgrades from the 2024.5 Backoffice version are as follow:

- **New Permissions**, to better manage the platform experience for all the users of the tenant.

   From this version it will be possible to manage the role's authorization using a semplified version of the authorization list. This will help to make it more manageable and intuitive to new and old users. for more information check the [Permission](docs/Backoffice/Permission/Description.md) section.


- **Tags system eliminated.** 

    Tags structure won't be available anymore.
