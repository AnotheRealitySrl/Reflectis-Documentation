# Environments

![bo_env](/img/bo_env.png)

The "**Environments**" section includes all **supplementary 3D environments** accessible within the application. 
Each environment can have unique** visual designs and interactions** customized to meet user preferences and the specific needs of the application.

Any new environment introduced in this section becomes accessible for use when creating **a new event**. As a result, it's made available within the application, ensuring its availability going forward.

# Uploading

Creating a new environment requires the utilization of the SDK creation kit provided alongside the application. For detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and using the SDK, please refer to the [Reflectis Creator Kit](/docs/CK/intro.md).
