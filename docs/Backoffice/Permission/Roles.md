Roles serve the purpose of effectively distinguishing the responsibilities and authorities allocated to each category of users. They facilitate the establishment of a hierarchical structure based on the roles assigned to individual users. Higher-ranking roles possess the capability to oversee critical aspects of the application, whereas lower-ranking roles typically entail simpler, less impactful duties.

To ensure clarity and avoid conflicts in permissions, it is recommended to assign a single role to each user.

Contrary to tags, when it comes to roles, users have two additional options: the ability to manage their visibility within the application and the possibility to designate them as default roles, which are the roles inherited by new users upon registration.
