Roles serve the purpose of effectively distinguishing the **responsibilities** and **authorities** allocated to each category of users.

They facilitate the establishment of a **hierarchical structure** based on the roles assigned to individual users. 
**Higher-ranking** roles possess the capability to oversee critical aspects of the application, whereas **lower-ranking** roles typically entail simpler, less impactful duties.

:::tip[Note]
To ensure clarity and avoid conflicts in permissions, it is recommended to assign a single role to each user.
:::

When it comes to roles, users have two options: the ability to **manage their visibility** within the application and the possibility to designate them as **default roles**, which are the roles inherited by new users upon registration.

## Create a role
To create a new role users can click the "**New Role**" button, situated at the top right corner of the screen.

This will open up a new window with three sections.

- The first section manages the **name and the color** of the role itself. It's possible to set a role as "**Visible**", so other people can see it under the nametag in the application, and set a role as "**Default**", so a new user will have this role. 
- In the second section it's possible to **associate** the role to specific users, or **remove** them
- The third section it's where the **permits** and **powers** are associated with that role.
