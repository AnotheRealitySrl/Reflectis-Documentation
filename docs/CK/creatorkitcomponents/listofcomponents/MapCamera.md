# Map Camera

```MapCameraPlaceholder```

Script component to attach to an *empty* object to make it a **map camera**. 
Create an empty object and attach this script to it. A camera will become attached to the empty object and it needs to be placed **on top of the map** to achieve the planar map feeling. 

What the camera sees is what will be presented when clicking "**Map**" on the "**Tablet**" function into the world. Move it and rotate it until it appears **flat** in the camera preview.
