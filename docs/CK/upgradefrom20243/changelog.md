# Changelog

From the 2024.3 Creator Kit version, the changes in this version are as follows:

- **Adding "scaling", "color picker" and "non-proportional scaling" in the Interactable placeholder**, now it's possible to implement the color picker, scaling and non-proportional scaling to environment objects via Creator Kit.
  For **more information**, check out the section [Interactable](../creatorkitcomponents/listofcomponents/Interactable).

- **Adding new Visual Scripting nodes**, these nodes help creators, optimising certain behaviours, checking for the presence of **other avatars** and **objects**, and attaching **certain functions** at specific points in a scene.
This is the list of the new nodes:
	- **Scene Nodes**, a subsection of [**Flow nodes**](../visualscripting/reflectisnodelist/Flow-nodes), to enable or disable the view of other avatars and objects.
	- **Scene Nodes**, a subsection of [**Event nodes**](../visualscripting/reflectisnodelist/eventnodes/Scene), to identify specific points in a scene.
	- [**Synced Event Nodes**](../visualscripting/networking/customnodeslist/Sync-Event-Nodes) and  [**Synced Flow Nodes**](../visualscripting/networking/customnodeslist/Sync-Flow-Nodes), reorganisation of previous networked nodes.
