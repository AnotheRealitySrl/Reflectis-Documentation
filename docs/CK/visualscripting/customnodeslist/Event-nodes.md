# Event nodes

In order for the synchronized variables to actually be displayed by other users, it’s necessary to use events in the "**Synced Object**" script.

Initially, you have to:
- Click on "**Edit Graph**" in the "**Script Machine**" and use the right mouse button to open a **dropdown menu**
- Click on "**Events**" and then on the "**Reflectis**" folder.

Inside the folder there will be two other folders:
- "**[Ownership](Ownership)**" - which is used to assign ownership to the user who wants to edit a feature of an object
- "**[Synced object](Synced-variables)**" - to edit a synchronized variable, which is linked to the object in question, and send the update to the server.
