# Prefabs

Prefabs to be dragged into the scene are divided into: panels and generic elements.

## Panels [WIP]

The prefabs of the panels in the Creator Kit are:

- Tutorial Panel
- Player list Panel
- Role Panel
- Dashboard Panel

## Generic elements [WIP]

The prefabs of the generic elements in the Creator Kit are:

- Portal Prefab
- Spawn point
- Big screen prefab

## Empty objects

The Creator Kit contains different **empty** objects already assembled to behave with a specific behavior. 
These objects lack a **3D mesh reference** so that any creator can position what they want as a 3D model.

If you want to add a 3D model, must insert a "**Mesh Filter**" component, a "**Mesh Renderer**" component and a **material**.
