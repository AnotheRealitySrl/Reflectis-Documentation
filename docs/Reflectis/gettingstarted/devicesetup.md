# VR Device Setup

Reflectis is supported by the **Meta Quest 2 and 3**, so to use it on a headset you need to install the **apk** from SideQuest.
Scroll down to learn how to properly install the application on the headset.

## Step 01: SideQuest Installation

These are the steps to install the **apk**:

1. Go to https://sidequestvr.com/

2. In the Main Menu, click on "**Get Sidequest**".

	[IMMAGINE]

3. Select "**Advanced Installer**".

	[IMMAGINE]

	When the download is **finished**, complete the software installation following the guided procedure.

4. Start the **SideQuest** application on your PC. On the topbar it will say "**Not Detected**" on the right side of a **red dot**, when no devices are connected.

## Step 02: Connecting the headset

:::danger[Warning]
 "**Developer mode**" must be already active. If you don’t know how to activate it, [here](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/#enable-developer-mode)’s a guide for you.
::: 

The steps to connect the headeset on SideQuest are:
- **Turn on** the Meta Quest
- **Connect** to a PC through USB cable
- **Enable** the device from the headset.

Now the red dot on the SideQuest application would turn from red to **green**.

:::tip[Note]
If it's **yellow**, it means the device has been found but needs to be granted access from the headset.
:::

### Why is the red dot still red even following the instructions?
Causes can be multiple, let's answer with the two most common situations:
First thing, check if the "**Developer mode**" is **active** on your headset.

Else, **disconnect** the headset from the computer, **close SideQuest** e proceed to install the **Oculus ADB drivers** for Windows, following the instructions at [this link](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-go-adb-drivers/).
Once completed the process, try to **reopen SideQuest** and connect your device.

Other causes could be not allowing the connection of the device from the headset, a **faulty USB cable** or an **old version** of the SideQuest launcher.

## Step 03: Yellow dot and authorizations
If the dot is yellow, "**Authorization required**" will appear on the side.

Wearing the headset while still connected to the computer will show an interactive PC access authorization panel. 
You have to select "**Allow**", so the SideQuest dot should've turned green.

## Step 04: Uninstall the apk's old version

If you're trying to put an **already installed application** in the headset, it's recommended to **uninstall** the old version before installing the new one. 

Otherwise, you can go to **step 5**.

1. Press this *grid* icon in the SideQuest's topbar.

	[IMMAGINE]

2. Find the **old version** of the application and press the settings icon to the side.
	
	[IMMAGINE]

3. Select "**Uninstall app**" in the configuration panel.

	[IMMAGINE]

4. Selecting the icon with the *tick* on the topbar allows you to check the un/installation status of the application.

## Step 05: Install the new version

Now it's time to install the **latest version** of the application:

1. Select the apk installation icon, to upload the file.

	[IMMAGINE]

2. Select the corret apk file from the PC.

	[IMMAGINE]

3. Wait a moment or click on the icon with the *tick* to check how the installation is going.
	If everything goes alright, you'll receive a **notification** as this one:

Now you can disconnect from the PC and **test the new application**, which can be found in the  "**Unknown Sources**" section of the headset application menu.
