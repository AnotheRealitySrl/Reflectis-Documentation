# Tablet

The **tablet** is a container that includes all the **tools** within the platform. 
This is represented visually by a virtual tablet, 2D in **WebGL** and as a 3D object in **VR**.

The tablet will have a **menu** with all the tools and functions that can be called up, including:
- **Events Dashboard**, a list in which the list of **public and private spaces** (to which one has been invited) that are **active** or **scheduled** is organized. 
It will be possible to filter by:
	- **Private events** to which you have been invited
	- **Public events** from the schedule
	- **Highlights**
	- List of **multimedia**, **3D assets** and **tools**, to be spawned and used in the room (where allowed) 
	- **Settings** (language, VR main hand, audio and voice chat adjustment, logout and environment saving).
