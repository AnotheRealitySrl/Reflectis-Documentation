# Dashboard and events

The **dashboard** is a panel that contains the events of the platform. 

Events are **public** or **private** sessions, created by users in a 3D environment chosen from those available, in which they can freely use the **available features**. 

The dashboard can be accessed either from a **tablet**, or **fixed** in certain predefined environments.

## Interaction with dashboard

In **WebGL** the interaction is as follows:
- For **fixed dashboards**, the user can click on it to *zoom in* on the screen and see it enlarged, so that he can read all the information clearly
- For **portable dashboards**, the user can click on the tablet and then on the *dashboard button* to open the panel with events.

In **VR** the interaction is as follows:
- For **fixed dashboards**, the user can approach and point the *controller* to the content
- For **portable dashboards**, the user can open the tablet and click with the *pointer* on the dashboard button, to open a panel with events.

## Event creation
In order to create a **new event**, the user has to access the tablet, in the **Dashboard section**, and click on the "**Create Event**" button.
He will have a panel available with these fields:
- **Title**
 If the event is to be **scheduled** (by entering a start and end date and time), or if it starts **at the moment** (by indicating the duration of the event)
- **Short description**
- **Category** and **subcategory**, among those added by backoffice
- If **highlighted** (only for Super User/Manager), in this case it will appear in the foreground on the dashboard
- **Environment**, choosing from those available on the platform.

Then, by clicking the "**Next**" button, the user can decide whether the event will be **public**, with a default limit of 30 people or unlimited, or private. 
In the latter case, you can decide whether to make it **hidden** for guests only or **visible**, but access will be by invitation only. 

To enter the users for whom the event is intended, you may enter their **nickname**, or directly add a **role or tag**.

The third step concerns the **permissions** to be assigned to roles and tags. The user may leave the default ones or change them according to your needs on the event.
Finally, the last panel is dedicated to the **files** to be shared in the event, among those that have already been uploaded from backoffice.

## Event management
In the "**My Events**" section on the tablet, the user can view events created by himself. Each event will have two buttons to **edit** or **delete** it.

The user can delete or edit an event that he has previously created through the "My Events" section on the tablet or by clicking on his event from a fixed dashboard.

Regarding removal, if the event is **in progress** and there are users in it, they won’t be kicked out of the room, but **can continue** to use it, until they voluntarily leave it.
