# Communication

Users can communicate on the platform through both **voice chat** and **text chat**, available in both WebGL and VR.

## Voice chat
The **voice chat** will be **spatialized**, meaning that only those within x meters range of the speaker can hear them, and it will be available in all **multiplayer environments**.
Some environments may have specific **private zones** with voice chat triggers, allowing users to **only hear the speaker** if they are inside the same area.

## Text chat
As for the **text chat**, it will be organized into **channels** (general, current event, private) and **will not have** a message history.

A user can send a **private message** directly to another user by clicking on their name from the user list.
Additionally, among the text chat channels, there will be an "**Announcements**" channel where the staff can post **real-time communications**.

From the text chat is possible to open the **Online user list**, from which you will be able to mute/kick a user in the same room as you (if the role allows it), to look at his profile and to open a private chat.

## Animations and reactions
Users will be able to communicate with each other through **animations** (full body and WebGL only) and **reactions** (2D images displayed above the avatar, both WebGL and VR) that can be activated with *quick choices* (shortcuts or in-game menu).

Animations and reactions **won’t have** physics or logic that interacts with the environment or other users.

## Speaker mode
Users with a specific permit will be able to activate the speaker mode through user interface. By activating the voice chat a new icon will become available. by clicking it the voice chat will change from spatialized to global so everybody in the event can hear you.
