# Welcome to Reflectis Creator Kit

Let's discover **Reflectis Creator Kit**, the suitable tool for creating personalized Reflectis environments. 

The obvious choice **for a developer** who wants to build a virtual social world to host it on his own space while coding his own interactions. 

Thanks to the already-made features and the available services & infrastructure, jumpstarting the development of custom environments becomes fast and easy.

## What is it?
**Reflectis Creator Kit** is a library of interactive prefabs and individual scripts that define various behaviors and interactions within Reflectis environments.

Additionally, several **drag-and-drop components** are present in the scene and ready for use: *Big screen*, *Whiteboard Surface*, *Teleport*, *Scene Changer*, *Private Voice Area*, *User List*, and so on.

However, before using them, it's necessary to **set up the project, set up the scene,** and **install and set up the addressable system** to receive the Creator Kit and all its functionalities.

Remember that the platform allows for the creation of **VR and WebGL** experiences, enabling both systems to coexist.


You can navigate this documentation using the **sidebar on the left**. Some categories have **sub-pages**, which you can expand by clicking on them.
