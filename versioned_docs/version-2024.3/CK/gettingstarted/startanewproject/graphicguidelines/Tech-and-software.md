# Tech & Software requirements
This section contains all the information needed to produce **3D assets**, **environments** and **scenes** for Reflectis projects (deployed in Webgl and VR) and generic **real-time VR applications** for mobile headsets such as Meta Quest 2/3 or Pico 4.

The main scope is to give **clear instructions** and methods to 3D artists, that are already familiar with Unity engine and real-time experiences, guiding them through an assets production pipeline that follows **AnotheReality guidelines** and **specifications** required to meet the company standards in terms of performance, hierarchy and quality, both visual and technical.

## What you need
- **Game engine**: Unity
- **Unity version** (mandatory for Reflectis projects): 2022.3.1
- **Unity modules**: Android/WebGL

## Desired output
**Unity package**, which contains all the models, textures, materials and prefabs correctly sorted by folders and named with a precise naming convention, following AnotheReality guidelines explained below in this guide.
