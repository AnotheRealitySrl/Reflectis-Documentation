# Test the experience
After publishing a scene, it’s time to **test it out**. 
Creators can test the outcome of the different set up objects in the scene for the different platforms available (**VR and web**). 

When you are in the platform, you can test your environment by entering the **event created** from the *back office*, or by creating it **directly** from the *3D world*, through the tablet.

## How to interact

Different platforms interact with the world in different ways:
1. **VR** - Using the Pointer & Trigger button
	- Point the controller toward the desired object
	- A blue ray will appear from the controller toward the object (only for interactable objects)
	- Press the **trigger button** on the back of the controller to select it and interact with it.

2. **WebGL** - Left Button Click on the interactable objects 
	- Move the mouse cursor over an object
	- Press the **left mouse button** to interact with it.
