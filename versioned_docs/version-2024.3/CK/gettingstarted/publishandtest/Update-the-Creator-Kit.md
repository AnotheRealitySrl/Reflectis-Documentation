# Update the Creator Kit

Periodically AnotheReality may want to update the **Reflectis Creator Kit** with **new components**, in which case a new version of the current document will be released and the package on Unity will also **need to be updated**.

To update the "**Reflectis-SDK**" and the "**Reflectis-SDK-CreatorKit**" you have to:
- Go to **your Unity project**
- Open the "**Package manager**" panel and search for the downloaded Git package
- Click on "**Update**" if available. The new features will be automatically uploaded to the current and future projects.
