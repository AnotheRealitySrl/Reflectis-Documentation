# Welcome to Reflectis Creator Kit

Let's discover **Reflectis Creator Kit**, the suitable tool for creating metaverses in the future. 

The obvious choice **for a developer** who wants to build a virtual social world and host it on his own space coding his own interactions, because it will be so quick to jumpstart the development thanks to already made features and available services & infrastructure.

## What's it?
**Reflectis Creator Kit** is a library of interactive prefabs and individual scripts that define various behaviors and interactions within Reflectis environments.

Additionally, several **drag-and-drop components** are present in the scene and ready for use: *Big screen*, *Whiteboard Surface*, *Teleport*, *Scene Changer*, *Private Voice Area*, *User List*, and so on.

However, before using them, it's necessary to **set up the project, set up the scene,** and **install and set up the addressable system** to receive the Creator Kit and all its functionalities.

Remember that the platform allows for the creation of **VR and WebGL** experiences, enabling both systems to coexist.


You can navigate this documentation using the **sidebar on the left**. Some categories have **sub-pages**, which you can expand by clicking on them.
