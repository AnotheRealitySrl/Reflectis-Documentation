Tags are employed to **identify** and **group** users more efficiently. These tags can be linked to a **limited** number of permissions that regulate users' abilities, determining which actions they are allowed or prohibited from performing, and which tools they can manage.

## Create a tag
To create a new tag users can click the "**New Tag**" button, situated at the top right corner of the screen.

This will open up a new window with three sections.

- The first section manages the **name and the color** of the tag itself
- In the second section it's possible to **associate** the tag to specific users, or **remove** them
- The third section it's where the **permits** and **powers** are associated with that tag.
