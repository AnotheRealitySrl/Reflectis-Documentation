# Movement

In **WebGL**, the movement of your avatar is controlled by *WASD* on the *keyboard*, and holding down the *right mouse button* to move the third-person camera. 

Meanwhile, in **VR** you can move in the area through teleport, with the *controller's upward stick*, and use the *controller stick* to move the view to the right or left.
