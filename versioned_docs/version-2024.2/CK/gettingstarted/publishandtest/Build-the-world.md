# Build the world
When the scene is completed it needs to build the addressables.
:::tip[Note] 
	Remember to first correctly **configure addressables** [here](../startanewproject/Addressable-setup).
:::

You have to click on "**Reflectis**" on the top bar and then choose the profile on which to build addressables: **Production** (official release) or **Sandbox** (for testing).

Once Unity has completed the compilation, you can move on to [publishing](Publish-the-world).
