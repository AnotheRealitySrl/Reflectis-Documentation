# Welcome to Reflectis

Reflectis is a **development platform** that enables the creation of **Virtual Social Worlds** and their interactive 3D content. 

## What's the vision?
*The Wordpress to create Virtual platforms in the future.* 

The easy way to go for your average Joe to create his virtual world, put some content on the go, without having to worry about setting up servers, accounts, multiplayer, voice chat and programming grabs and character controller.

But also the obvious choice **for a developer** who wants to build a virtual social world and host it on his own space coding his own interactions, because it will be so quick to jumpstart the development thanks to already made features and available services & infrastructure.

## What can I do?
In Reflectis you can socialize and collaborate with other users, through the different tools available and according to the nature of each environment. 
Each user, through the Creator Kit offered by Reflectis, will be able to build his or her own environment either through pre-defined drag-and-drop components, or through visual scripting, for more extensive customization.

More info about **Creator Kit** [here](/docs/2024.3/CK/intro)!
