## Create a folder
To **create a folder**, users should click on the **folder icon** positioned at the top center of the page. A side panel will appear, allowing the user to assign a **name** to the new folder. 
After naming, clicking "**Save**" will list the folder as a usable one. 

:::tip[Note]
It's important that empty folders **can't persist** and will be **automatically removed**.
