# First steps

To join **Reflectis**, just follow the steps depending on which platform you want to use!

## What you need

1. **VR application**: Download and install the Reflectis application (*link available soon on AppLab*).
	Reflectis is available on **Meta Quest 2**, **Meta Quest 3** and **Pico 4**.
2.  **Web application**: Nothing to download! Click on [this](https://app.reflectis.io/) to register and access the web application. 

## Registration
VR and WebGL users **must register** to access both applications. 
The registration portal is accessible through the [landing page](https://app.reflectis.io/).

After completing the registration you are ready to enter the **Reflectis Virtual Platform**!

## Creating account
Before entering the 3D world, it is required to **create your profile** and **an avatar**, through the Ready Player Me software.

First, you need to fill out this information (**only the username is mandatory**):

*You are now ready to access the virtual platform*!

To learn the system of movement and interaction with the environment, you can consult [this guide](../3dworld/intro).

## Choosing the World
After successfully logging in you'll be redirected to the selection of the World you want to enter inside the Tenant. The list is comprised of only the Worlds where the user has been granted access to.

If the user has access only to one world in the Tenant, he'll be instantly redirected to that world's landing page instead.

The same page structure is similar to the world's backoffice page selection, as shown in the [Backoffice Selection](docs/Backoffice/BackOfficeSelection.md) section of the documentation.

## Accessing the World's Landing Page

After the world has been selected, the user will be redirected to its landing page:

In this page you'll be able to access the Reflectis Virtual platform in the following ways:
- Entering the **Web application** by pressing the Web option on the left.
- Pairing the VR headset with your account to access the virtual platform via **VR application**.

To learn how to **pair your headset** check the [VR Pairing](vrpairing) section.
