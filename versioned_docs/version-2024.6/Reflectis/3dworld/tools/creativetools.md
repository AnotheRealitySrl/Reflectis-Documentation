# Creative tools

From the tablet it will be possible to access **Reflectis tools** (to be defined which user roles will be accessible):
- Pencil [*VR only*], to draw in 2D on the whiteboard or in 3D in the environment.
- Laser pointer [*VR only*], is used to target any element in the environment.
- Whiteboard, you can spawn them in the environment and use the pencil to write on it.

## Pencil

:::tip[Note]
Currently the pencil is **only available in VR**.
:::

When the user chooses to use it, it will **spawn a pencil** on the user's right hand and **a palette** on the left hand (**reversed** if the user has changed the main hand option).
There will be *predefined colors* on the palette, a button to activate the *eraser*, and one to change the *thickness of the pencil*.

The pencil can be used either in **3D**, in any space, or on a **2D whiteboard**. To activate it, simply press the *trigger* of the controller on which the pencil is on.

To **remove the pencil**, simply return to the tablet menu and click on the *tool* button again.

## Laser pointer

:::tip[Note]
The laser pointer is **only available in VR**. 
:::

When the user chooses to use it, it will **spawn a pointer** on the user's main hand.
The pointer will **already be active**, so simply pointing it at the desired object will display a red dot of detection.

To **remove** the pointer, simply return to the tablet menu and click on the *tool* button again.

## Whiteboard

:::tip[Note]
Currently the virtual whiteboard **can't be used in WebGL**, but only be spawned. While in **VR** it is possible to use it with the pencil.
:::

When the user chooses to **spawn a whiteboard**, it appears in front of him. 

The whiteboard can be grabbed from the **white side handles**, through the grab of one of the *controllers* in **VR**, or with the *left-click* on one of the handles, in **WebGL**. 

To change the position, rotation or scale, just follow the **same controls** as in the [Assets](../interactions/assets) section.

**Multiple whiteboards** can be called into the environment at the same time and can be **deleted** by interacting with the *X* button in the upper right corner of the board.
